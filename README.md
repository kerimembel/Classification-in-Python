# Classification-in-Python

## Description
In this project, certain classification algorithms will be run in the Python environment. For this dataset, different input parameters will be tried in different algorithms, the most suitable parameters for every algorithm will be found and the most successful algorithm will be determined according to these results.

Dataset used in this project: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data

The algorithms to be tried are listed below.
 - Decision tree (C5.0) 
 - Support Vector Machine 
 - K Nearest Neighbors 
 - Naive Bayes 
 - Neural network     
 - Random forest

To run these algorithms in Python environment, a machine learning library named scikit-learn has been used.
## Usage
These code files were run in Python 3.6.5 64-bit environment.
In order to run these files completely and correctly, the libraries specified in the "requirements.txt" file must be installed. 

To do this, "pip install -r .\requirements.txt" command should be run in the directory where the files are located.

The file "classification.py" must be run to execute the classification algorithms.

The "visualize.py" file must be run to see the results created with different parameters that I have tried before.
